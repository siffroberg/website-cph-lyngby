            <h2>Project description</h2>
            <p>For the exam project, the task was to develop a website which forms a portfolio,<br> 
                starting from what I have learned in the first semester.<br> 
                The portfolio should contain previous projects and updates of what I have learned during the year. Project planning,<br>
                 justifications and explanations had to be available.
                 <br> Furthermore, a video had to be produced for the site.
                </p>

    <h2>Project management</h2>
    <p>My work started with doing project management, so I had a full overview of the scope of the task and time consumption.
        <br> This started with a PBS, which describes what my portfolio should consist of. 
        <br>In addition, I created a WBS, which outlined the work tasks,</p>

</div> <div class="column">
    <h2>My idea</h2>
    <p>The idea was that the website should exude personality and give the user the feeling of me right away.
        <br> The front page had to give the user a clear idea of ​​what kind of site this is,
        <br> and then with an atmospheric background which supported the color choice. The problem was just that,
        <br> I didn't know what would radiate me and give the user a sense of who I am as a person.
        <br> For a long time I didn't know what my website should look like.
        I later had to admit that with my current skills I could not bring my idea to life at this time.
        <br> Then I had to come up with a whole new alternative. still trying to make it me, but in a more simple way.

                    <h1>Original Design</h1>
                    <p>This was originally what i had in mind, leaning towards a more toned down feel
                        <br>but still a lot of characther but i think i made it too dificult for myself.
                        <br> I made my html and css in different folders and eventually I lost track.
                        <br> so for the best possible result I decided to redo it. I'm glad I did.
                        <br>I am well aware that this is not the perfect website whatsoever, 
                        <br>and I'm a little sad that I couldn't complete what I set out to do,
                        <br> but as I get further into the education and my skills grow I will be able to make my dream portfolio

           <a href="file:///C:/Users/Bruger/Desktop/Unavngivet%20dokument%20(2).pdf" target="_blank"><h2>Style/Inspo</h2></a>
            <p>I wanted the user to want to scroll down because it was exciting
                <br> and wanted to see more about me and my work.
                <br>Ive only used two colours trhoughout my portfolio, black and white because my original design also didnt have many colours.
                <br>the only thing that appears to have colour are the social areal. I made the choise to make a hover effect. making it a box hover effect,
                <br> so when you put your mouse over it, it will come forward with this red color, as i found it fitting for the different icons
                <br> as it was the best match for me, and also trying in someway to stay true to my original design
                <br> As for my inspiration I, i looked through pinterest and found lots of
                <br> good templates i wanted to recreate or at least work around, but like i said earlier on i had to come to term with 
                <br>my skills was not yet there. All though it wasnt an easy process I have learned a lot, and gotten a lot more knowledge on the subject
                <br> for that I am greatfull
                <br>
                <br>Even though it is as simple as it gets, i still tried to make it appear put together trhoughout the whole site.
                <br>However, the appearance of the boxes had to repeat itself throughout the site, to give recognition
                <br> and not make it all too messy and unpredictable. As we know it from the Gestalt laws of equality, and symmetry and order. 
                <br> As for the font, i chose to use cursive and the headings still cursive but making them bold so they would stand out even more from the rest of the text.

   <a href="file:///C:/Users/Bruger/Desktop/Unavngivet%20dokument.pdf" target="_blank"><h2>Coding</h2></a>
    <p>I honestly found the coding really difficult, it surtenly didnt come easy.
        <br> I have learned a lot by making mistakes, and learning to see for myself the mistakes that i made.
        <br>It has made me faster at realizing my mistakes and how to fix them.
        <br>In my overall coding I have used display-flex to define my containers and given them the right value to fit my exact liking
        <br> as well as giving my boxes a nice round edge using border-radius. so it would give them a softer look.
         <br> I also used it for my gallery part.
         <br>i have used align, justify-content as well as padding and
         <br> margin-left and right to create my layout as best as I could.
         <br>I wanted it to be as simple as possible. thats why my color-scheme is black and white.
         <br> and only using colours where i felt it would fit in, as for an eksempel in my photo-gallery
         <br> the colour of the font i used rgb(188, 81, 155), as well as using the colour rgb(131, 27, 27) on my effect for the social section.

   <a href="img.op/cph.mp4" target="_blank"><h2>Video</h2></a>
    <p>I really had trouble finding a good idea for the video.
        <br> it was a lot of thinking and brainstorming, also 
        <br>asking others about their opinion on what could be a creative video.
        <br>I didnt want my video to be all over the place, so i had to take my time.
        <br>I decided that i would film the video at our school, mainly because it was a great location, 
        <br>and i got help from one of my class mates to film, which was a great help.
        <br>The video is edited in Premiere Pro.
